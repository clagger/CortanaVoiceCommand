# CortanaVoiceCommand
Windows UWP app which implements custom voice commandos for interacting with Cortana

This application offers the opportunity to ask Cortana about the population of countries from the past (1960+) and predicts
the future population.

To start the application, start cortana and speak clear "Listen Up"

Then you can ask two different questions:

for the population of the past

show me the population of [country] in [year]

for the population in the future <b>(in progress)</b>

what will be the population of [country] in [year]

this project is based on a Windows-universal-samples project
